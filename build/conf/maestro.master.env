# Please READ carefully the `build/README.md' on how bootstrapping is built to update this file accordingly.
#
#
# This file is loaded by default by the branch detected on your system. But you can force it with --gitbranch
#

# Build Configuration FileName convention
# =======================================
#
# This build configuration file name is built from 2 variables set by build.sh
# BUILD_CONFIG is retrieved from default git branch (ie master) or --build-config master
# APP_PATH is retrieved from --box-name maestro

# When you start your build with --build-config and --box-name, 
# this file will need to be named as ${APP_PATH}.${BUILD_CONFIG}.env (located by --build-config-dir)

# HPCloud Account naming
# ======================
#
# You need to create the 'FORJ_HPC' in your HPCloud setup with hpcloud account:setup <FORJ_HPC>.
# to simplify, we used 'dev' as HPCloud account to use.
# If you already have an HPCloud account set, you can change it there.
# Otherwise, build.sh, will create that one, based on the 'hp' account.

FORJ_HPC=dev

# If you want to have a generic way to define your HPCloud account configuration based on this configuration file,
# you can set it like:
# FORJ_HPC=${APP_PATH}.${BUILD_CONFIG}.dev

# Ensure HPCloud account settings
# ===============================

# To ensure that some definition for your build configuration, update any of the following as needed. (FORJ_HPC_*)
# Uncomment any of those FORJ_HPC_* to force there usage with this build configuration:
